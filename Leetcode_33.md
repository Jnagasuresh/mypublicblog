### Java Code Explanation: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

The provided Java code is an implementation of the "Search in Rotated Sorted Array" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews. The goal is to find a target element within a rotated sorted array.

```java
public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
    int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;

    while (l <= r) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        if (nums[m] == target)
            return m;

        if (nums[l] <= nums[m]) {
            // If the left part is sorted.
            if (nums[l] <= target && target <= nums[m])
                r = m - 1;
            else
                l = m + 1;
        } else {
            // If the right part is sorted.
            if (nums[m] <= target && target <= nums[r])
                l = m + 1;
            else
                r = m - 1;
        }
    } // End of while

    return -1;
}

```

### Explanation

The `search` method takes two parameters: an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`. It returns the index of the target element in the array if found, or `-1` if the target is not present.

The method's workflow is as follows:

1. **Initialization:** The method starts by initializing two pointers: `l` pointing to the leftmost element (initially 0), and `r` pointing to the rightmost element (initially `nums.length - 1`).

2. **Search Loop:** The code enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`, ensuring a valid search range.

3. **Middle Index Calculation:** Inside the loop, the middle index `m` is calculated as the average of `l` and `r`.

4. **Target Check:** The code then checks if the element at index `m` equals the target. If so, it returns the index `m` as the target is found.

5. **Sorted Array Check:** If the element at index `l` is less than or equal to the element at index `m`, it indicates that the left part of the array is sorted.

   - If the target falls within the range of the sorted left part (between `nums[l]` and `nums[m]`), the `r` pointer is updated to `m - 1` to search the left half.
   - If the target is not within this range, the `l` pointer is updated to `m + 1` to search the right half.

6. **Unsorted Array Check:** If the element at index `l` is greater than the element at index `m`, it indicates that the right part of the array is sorted.

   - If the target falls within the range of the sorted right part (between `nums[m]` and `nums[r]`), the `l` pointer is updated to `m + 1` to search the right half.
   - If the target is not within this range, the `r` pointer is updated to `m - 1` to search the left half.

7. **Loop Termination:** The loop continues until `l` is greater than `r`, at which point the search range is exhausted, and the loop terminates.

8. **Target Not Found:** If the target is not found within the array, the method returns `-1`.

The `search` method employs a binary search approach, capitalizing on the sorted nature of specific parts of the rotated array to efficiently locate the target element. This solution has a time complexity of O(log N), making it an efficient way to solve the "Search in Rotated Sorted Array" problem.
